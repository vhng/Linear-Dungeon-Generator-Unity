  Procedural generate a simple dungeon with a linear patch using blocks. The path will always link the first block to the last block along all blocks in the way.
  
  Its scalable, you can edit the size of the dungeon and the prefab of the generated room.

  Still under development. Feel free to use in any kind of commercial or non-commercial project.

  Made by me Victor Nunes, vhndev.
